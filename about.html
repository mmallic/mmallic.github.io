            <div class="about">
            <p>My name is Madhumita Mallick and I have been living in Atlanta for the past 5 years. During this time, I have been working
            as a Business Support Analyst at DHS. My experience includes data analysis and QA testing, skills that I have developed and refined on the job.
            Throughout my career, I have excelled at validating outcomes and identifying defects. For instance, while leading the UAT team at CHFS, I ensured our project was highly user-friendly and virtually error-free.
            Looking ahead, I am eager to broaden my experience across various industries.
